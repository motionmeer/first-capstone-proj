    <h3> Eyaan Meer was born and raised in the amazing, fast paced city of dallas or as some would say the New York of the south. <br>
        Coming from a background of an immigrant family that lived in one the few business hubs in the USA, Eyaan had a natrual inclanation towards 3 things. 
        People, Innovation, and Money. From a young age he decided to make these 3 pursuits his purpose, he just neeeded to figure out how. So after years and years of research and even internig at 
        leading psychiatric clinic for 2 years
        he started his first pursuit at the age of 17; a financial trading/coaching company. it was the perfect combination of his 3 pursuits.
        shortly after growing the company to a 6 figure business he decided to step into a different market which was real estate. Even though he fell in love with the business he didn't believe there was
        enough philanthropy in it for it so he started th esearch again. eventually, ending up on coding. It was almost perfecht timing. AI was just coming out, neurotech was becoming huge and as was fintech. Currently he is working on getting an elite coding diploma from a preestigious coding  university.
        Once he's finished his plans are to pursue the fintech industry to make a name for himself in the corporate world and hopefully help as many people as possible on the way.
